# go-react-serverles-ssr-boilerplate
A fullstack boilerplate that integrates golang + webpack + react + serverless ssr

It's a SPA that uses:
- golang for the backend
- webpack and react for the fronend
- Serverless Framework for the Server Side Rendering. Each page served by golang makes a request to a nodejs lambda to get the HTML and CSS before rendering the SPA.


I'll use this in my next side projects. (wish me luck!)
